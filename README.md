Course Name: Data Science Career Track
Project Description: This project was part of requirements for successful completion of the data science course work at <http://www.springboard.com>

## Objective
Compare the performance of different neural networks in multi-class classffication with decision trees as the bench mark models.

To achieve the desired objective, the project had following subgoals:
1. Classifying a give text (in this case tweets) in one of the three categories:
  - hate speech
  - offensive language
  - neither
2. Evaluating the performance of the different machine learning models as multi-class classfiers for tweets
  - when dataset is unbalanced
  - when data set is balanced
  
Due to the difference in the data sets, the project was split into two individual mini projects.For most part the basic steps of analysis were same:

1. Data Wrangling
2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Extraction
3. Baseline model selection
4. Neural networks to com
